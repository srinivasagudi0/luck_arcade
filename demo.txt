I’m encountering the following error, so please use the provided link. Simply copy and paste it, and you should be redirected quickly.

Failed to update project: Demo URL could not be verified (idk why, pls let an admin know if this is happening a lot and you’re sure that the URL is valid): too many redirects; last one to:
https://share.streamlit.io/-/auth/app?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fluckarcade-4pbrg54uurww9zh3xrqp5e.streamlit.app%2F

The verifier is being redirected to a Streamlit login page, so it can’t access the app automatically. This causes a redirect loop and the URL verification fails.
